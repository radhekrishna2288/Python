    "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) OOP is a programming paradigm, or style of programming, that organizes software design around data or objects, \n",
    "rather than functions and logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of OOPS:-\n",
    "Flexibility\n",
    "Modularity\n",
    "Reusability\n",
    "Maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) The class is a user-defined data structure that combines the methods and data members into a single entity. Classes \n",
    "are sort of like blueprints or templates for code in the production of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Objects are instances of classes.It consists of a set of methods and attributes. Actions are carried out using a \n",
    "class's object. Any object needs to have unique identification. An attribute of an object reflects both the properties \n",
    "and the state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Abstraction focuses on hiding implementation details aims at delivering only the minimum amount of functionality \n",
    "to ease the user's interaction and avoid complications. This is achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, and abstract \n",
    "methods that describe what a system can do but not how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation focuses on bundling data and methods within a single object ensures that the data is not accessible or \n",
    "modifiable without proper authorization, thus maintaining its integrity and privacy. Access modifiers such as public, \n",
    "private, and protected control the visibility. It is similar to a capsule that keeps the medicine safe and protects it \n",
    "from the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods that are surrounded \n",
    "by double underscores, such as __init__. These methods allow you to define how instances of your classes behave when they are \n",
    "used with built-in Python functions or operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common dunder methods are: __init__ , __str__ , __repr__ , __add__ , __len__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Inheritance plays a significant role in an object-oriented programming language. Inheritance in Python refers to the process \n",
    "of a child class receiving the parent class's properties. The reuse of code is inheritance's main goal. Instead of starting from \n",
    "scratch when developing a new class, we can use the existing class instead of re-creating it from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "  #synatx of inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Baseclass:\n",
    "      #body of Baseclass\n",
    "    class Derivedclass(Baseclass):\n",
    "      #body of Derivedclass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) In OOP, polymorphism refers to an object's capacity to assume several forms. Simply said, polymorphism enables us to carry \n",
    "out a single activity in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overloading is the practice of invoking the same method more than once with different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is the process of providing a different implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass \n",
    "within a subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Encapsulation is a Python technique for combining data and functions into a single object. A class, for instance, contains all \n",
    "the data i.e. methods and variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A class's data members and methods can be made private or protected in order to achieve encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three different access modifier types that Python offers are:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Public member: from outside of class, anywhere accessible.\n",
    "Private member: Within the class, accessible.\n",
    "Protected member: Within the class and its subclasses, accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) A constructor is a particular method used in object-oriented programming to generate and initialise an object of a class. \n",
    "In the class, this method is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They can access or modify class \n",
    "state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "  class ClassName(object):\n",
    "  @classmethod\n",
    "  def method(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):\n",
    "    ....\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are methods that belong to the class and don't access or modify class or instance state. They are defined using \n",
    "the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#syntax\n",
    "  class ClassName(object):\n",
    "  @staticmethod\n",
    "  def method(arg1, arg2, ...):\n",
    "    ....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Two or more methods have the same name but different numbers of parameters or different types of parameters, or both. These \n",
    "methods are called overloaded methods and this is called method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a \n",
    "specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) In Python, a property decorator is a powerful tool that allows you to define class attributes as if they were regular \n",
    "attributes while actually controlling their access and behavior behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Property decorators provide a clean and elegant way to manage attribute access in Python classes. By using property decorators \n",
    "effectively, you can create more robust and well-structured object-oriented code because they enhance code readability, \n",
    "maintainability, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that enables a single interface or method to operate \n",
    "differently based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: This reduces code duplication and enhances reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and Extensibility: This makes it easier to extend and maintain systems over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Code: Polymorphism simplifies code by allowing developers to use common interfaces for different types, which leads \n",
    "to cleaner and more readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Behavior: Polymorphism supports dynamic method invocation enabling decisions to be made at runtime about which method to \n",
    "call.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint or template for other classes, \n",
    "defining a common interface and enforcing a specific structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) The advantages of OOPs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: This promotes code reuse, reducing development time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: This makes the code more adaptable to changes and easier to extend with new features.\n",
    "Improved Code Readability: OOP promotes a more organized and structured approach to coding, making it easier for developers to \n",
    "understand and maintain the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration: OOP facilitates collaboration among developers by providing a clear and well-defined structure for organizing code.\n",
    "Real-World Modeling: OOP allows you to model real-world entities and their relationships in a natural and intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Class Variables Shared among all instances: Class variables are shared by all objects created from the same class.\n",
    "Defined within the class: They are defined within the class but outside any method.\n",
    "Accessed using the class name: Accessed using the class name followed by the dot operator like this:- ClassName.variable_name\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique to each instance: Instance variables are specific to each object created from the class.\n",
    "Defined within the constructor __init__ or other methods: Usually defined within the __init__ method.\n",
    "Accessed using the object name: Accessed using the object name followed by the dot operator like this:- object_name.variable_name\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) In Multiple inheritance One child class may inherit from several parent classes when there is multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance allows classes to inherit and combine the behavior of multiple parent classes, providing flexibility in \n",
    "designing complex class hierarchies. However, it's important to carefully consider the design and potential complexities that \n",
    "can arise when using multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19.Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are dunder methods used to control how objects are represented as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "__str__(self): This method is called when the str() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return a string \n",
    "representation of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "__repr__(self): This method is called when the repr() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return an \n",
    "unambiguous string representation of the object, which can be used to recreate the object.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Q20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) The super() function is essential in Python for managing inheritance. It simplifies code, promotes reusability, and \n",
    "ensures proper initialization and method resolution in complex inheritance scenarios. It is particularly powerful in systems \n",
    "with multiple inheritance or dynamic class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) The __del__ method in Python is a special method, also known as the destructor, which is called when an object is about to \n",
    "be destroyed. Its primary purpose is to define cleanup actions that need to occur before the object's memory is deallocated \n",
    "by the garbage collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of __del__ method:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleanup Operations: The primary purpose of __del__ is to perform any necessary cleanup operations before an object is \n",
    "permanently removed from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing files that the object was using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Releasing external resources like:- network connections or database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) @staticmethod:\n",
    "\n",
    "No Implicit First Argument: It does not take any implicit first argument (like self or cls).\n",
    "No Access to Class or Instance: It cannot access or modify instance-level (self) or class-level (cls) data.\n",
    "Utility Functions: Primarily used for utility functions that logically belong to the class but don't need to access class or \n",
    "instance-specific data.\n",
    "Inheritance: Static methods can be inherited and overridden by subclasses.\n",
    "Called on Class or Instance: Can be called on both the class and its instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "@classmethod:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit First Argument (cls): It takes the class (cls) as the first argument.\n",
    "Access to Class Data: It has access to class-level data and can modify class-level attributes.\n",
    "Alternative Constructors: Often used for defining alternative constructors or methods that operate on the class rather than \n",
    "an instance.\n",
    "Inheritance: Class methods can be inherited and overridden by subclasses, and they will receive the subclass as cls when called \n",
    "from an instance.\n",
    "Called on Class or Instance: Can be called on both the class and its instances, but always receives the class as the first \n",
    "argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Polymorphism, in the context of object-oriented programming, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects \n",
    "of a common type. In Python, inheritance plays a crucial role in achieving polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "      \n",
    "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Method chaining is a powerful technique in Python that allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single, \n",
    "continuous line of code. This approach makes the code cleaner, more readable, and often easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of method chaining in python are: Improved Readability, Enhanced Fluency, Reduced Boilerplate\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. This means that you \n",
    "can make objects of a class behave like callable functions. When you define the __call__ method in a class, you enable instances\n",
    "of that class to be invoked using parentheses, just like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "Making Objects Callable: Allows instances of a class to be called like a function using parentheses ().\n",
    "Custom Behavior: Enables defining custom logic that runs when the object is called.\n",
    "Dynamic Dispatch: Facilitates dynamic behavior changes, like handling different arguments or performing computations based on \n",
    "the call.\n",
    "Functionality Encapsulation: Lets you encapsulate behavior inside an object, making the object more versatile.\n",
